# GAN projects

Repository consists of multiple projects that work several GAN architectures. In these projects, I have manually built the AI model, collected the data and trained with high-end GPUs and RAM
First one I have manually web-scraped over 10k images from the internet, converted them into grayscale. Built and trained a pix2pix architecture from the ground-up for it to learn how to revert to its colourised form. 

Similarly, I worked with another anime colourizer dataset where the user provides the anime outline and, the AI learns how to colourise the outline. I used a higher-end NVIDIA A100 GPU for this, due to the various requirements and massive dataset. Training can also be done with Nvidia T4 but it is painstaking slow.
